// ideas for my dao - I got help from gpt...

// a user profile - there profile will show your address, balance and an "Achievement Cards" (an Achievement Card will show something like this on your profile: e.g. “Genesis Miner”, “DAO Founder”, “Validator”)

// the next idea is having perks / updates for the blockchain only for the winner.
// you could win one of the following:

// Mining Boosts -- +10% block rewards for 24 hours
// Gas Discounts -- Less transaction fee in your simulation
// Extra Vote Power -- For a limited time

// the last idea for my dao is - a secret channel. 
// For example, if you win the dao today, you win access to a discord server (made by me and possibly a discord bot...)
// this would give my users of my dao a very good insentive to want to use my dao, because they can be "Beta tester(s)", "early access to new features" and "vip dao meetings"

// I am going to combine these above 3 ideas into the one dao project. So you could win either, a awesome name for your profile, win higher block rewards or win access to a private (VIP) discord or slack community!
