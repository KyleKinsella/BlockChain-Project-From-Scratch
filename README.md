<p>The content below is not very professional just yet, it's quite forward but I'll update it in due course.</p>

## Did I start this project a while ago?
<p>Short answer is, <strong>yes</strong>. I was working on this project after I was done my final semester of college. I started to make this project while I waited to get my college results. But once the results 
came out, I just stopped working on the project. This was back roughly at some time in June 2025.</p>

## Why Have I Returned?
<p>The main reason to why I returned to this project, is boredom. I was working on a project but now that project is complete. After I completed that project, I thought of two ideas:
  <ol>
    <li>A Game</li>
    <li>Job Application Tracker</li>
  </ol>
  . I thought of making a video game, but after some thought and analysis, I decided to not proceed with this project (I will mabye come back to it in the future...). The after about omne or two days I thought of another project, Job Application Tracker. A project to keep track of job applications that you have submitted. With this project I did do some work on it for about a week, but then I realized that I am creating a pointless project. Why is it pointless, I was not using it for tracking my application (I was using excel...), so after some further analysis I decided to abort this project. 
</p>

<p>Then I started to think of some new project ideas: 
    <ol>
      <li>Spotify Clone</li>
      or
      <li>Linkedin Clone</li>
    </ol>
    . But then I thought I have my blockchain project on my portfolio that I started a few months back - I could go back to that project (that would be very fun!). So that night I thought if I wanted to revist my blockchain project and after a bit of thinking I said: "yes why not!". And now, I'm having lots of writing code, debugging issues and many more issues / problems that you always encounter when making a project (but, this is part of the learing phase!) 
</p>

## What is the importance of this project?
<p>The main objective / importance of this project is to create a fully working project and to learn as much as I can. But, another importance of this project is to 
show future / potential employers that I'm capable of developing a full-stack project, from nothing -> a fully working project (or product, if I was working on a 
  company project.). Although I don't have any professional software devlopment experience, I have lots of expiernce with most of the topics in software development, such 
  as: Dev-Ops, Unit testing, UML, Concurrent Development, Data Structures & algorithms, operating systems, object orientied programming (oop), Software Engineering, Design Patterns, Data Science & Machine Learning and so much more. I also have some expeince in the world of retail. I worked in my local cineam for 3 years and 7 months. While I 
  worked at my local cinema (Movies@ Gorey), I developed these soft skills: teamwork, communication, problem solving, dealing with hard / difficult customers, this developed   my patince, active listening and always being polite no matter the situation and most importantly always being professional in a work environment. 
</p>

## What is this project? 
<p>This project is a small simulation of a blockchain system. The core idea of this project is to create a full-stack project that simiulates how a blockchain system operates.</p>

## Technology Stack
<p>This project is split into both frontend, backend and deployment. See below headings for the tech stack:</p>
<h3>Frontend</h3>
<ul>
  <li>HTML</li>
  <li>CSS</li>
  <li>JavaScript</li>
  <li>React</li>
</ul>

<!-- <br> -->

<h3>Backend</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Go (currently my entire backend is in <strong><u>Go</u></strong>)</li>
  <li>Python (mabye in the later stages of the project)</li>
</ul>

<!-- <br> -->

<h3>Version Control</h3>
<p>It's very important to keep a log to some degree, so I am using:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Git</li>
</ul>

<br>
<p>to do this for my project. Git is a very good resouce to keep track of your current and old code.</p>

<!-- <br> -->

<h3>Deployment</h3>
<p>This part I have not gotten to yet, I'm currently developing the project locally but once the project is coming to a close or looks better than it's currently I will get it to deployed, so people can use and viee my 
this project that I have created. When the project is deployed I'm thinking of using the following deployment stack, see below:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Docker</li>
  <li>AWS (mabye!)</li>
  <li>Vercel</li>
  <li>and I'll do further research of other deployment technologys that I can use</li>
</ul>

<br>

## Current Features
### TODO
<p>Below are the features that I have so far for my project:</p>
<ul>
  <li>creating blocks</li>
  <li>proof of work (pow) algorithm (this is what each block needs to make a block on my blockchain at the moment)</li>
  <li>proof of stake algorithm (I did this a while ago, I need to make my pos algorithm much better)</li>
  <li>have the backend connect to the frontend</li>
</ul>

## Potential Features
### TODO
<p>below are the upcoming / potential features, see below:</p>
<ul>
  <li>block rewards</li>
  <li>transaction fee's</li>
  <li>Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) - I'm going to make my own DAO, but my DAO will take a good bit of inspiration from 
    <a href="https://nouns.wtf/">nouns.wtf</a>.</li>
  <li>I'm not sure what other features that I might develop, but I'll hopefully come up with some ideas...</li>
</ul>

## Images of the project
<!-- <h3>This image is how my project looked when I came back to it</h3> -->
<pre>Image 1:</pre>
<p>This image, is what I did on the day that came back to this project. I did have it to just show each blocks data on the frontend.</p>
<img src="images/13thofnovember.jpg" width="600" height="400" alt="13thofnovember">

<pre>Image 2 & Image 3:</pre>
<p>The next day, I worked on putting each blocks data into its own div. So, each block is it's own div. And in order to see the blocks data you need to click on the button: "Show Data", once this is 
clicked it will show the data in each block, then the button state will change to: "Hide Data" once the button is clicked again, the data in each block will be hidden. I was not sure how to do this, so I asked 
ChatGPT for some help with this and he did help me implement this feature.</p>

<!-- <pre>Image 3:</pre> -->
<!-- <p>todo</p> -->

<pre>Image 4:</pre>
<p>On Sunday the 16th of November, I updated how a blocks div looks. Before the block was completyly empty until you click on the "Show Data" button. Now I updated it to show what Block is for each div and a line to make 
  reading the data about each block more each to view / see / read. I also added an arrow from one block to the next block, this is to show that the first block (genesis block) is linked to the next n blocks that are created. The last block that is created in the blockchain will not have an arrow, why? because he is the last block in the chain and he is not "chained" to another block just yet, but we mine (create) more blocks he will then get an arrow.  
</p>

<p>Image 5:</p><img src="images/17thofnovember.jpg" width="600" height="400" alt="17thofnovember">

<h3><strong>Note:</strong></h3>

<!-- <br> -->

<p>
  When you look at image 5, you will see that the arrow is in the div for the block (this is for each block). I didn't want it to look like that, but unfortunatly, due to the design of React, I cannot have the arrow outside   of the div :( My idea was to have each block have it's data and outside of each block have the arrow point to the next block but I cannot do this with React... This part of the project might change later on!
