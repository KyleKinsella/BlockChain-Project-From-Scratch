I am currently building a blockchain project, with some of the core features of the blockchain such as: Proof of work algorithm, blocks, wallets, public and private keypairs, consensus and much more. I am building this project primarily with the Go programming language, I might use Python in the later stages of this project. I am using React to make my user-interface for this project.
