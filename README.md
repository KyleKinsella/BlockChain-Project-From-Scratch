## Did I start this project a while ago?
<p>Short answer is, <strong>yes</strong>. I was working on this project after I was done my final semester of college. I started to make this project while I waited to get my college results. But once the results 
came out, I just stopped working on the project. This was back roughly at some time in June 2025.</p>

## Why Have I Returned?
<p>The main reason to why I returned to this project, is boredom. I was working on a project but now that project is complete. After I completed that project, I thought of two ideas:
  <ol>
    <li>A Game</li>
    <li>Job Application Tracker</li>
  </ol>
  . I thought of making a video game, but after some thought and analysis, I decided to not proceed with this project (I will mabye come back to it in the future...). The after about omne or two days I thought of another project, Job Application Tracker. A project to keep track of job applications that you have submitted. With this project I did do some work on it for about a week, but then I realized that I am creating a pointless project. Why is it pointless, I was not using it for tracking my application (I was using excel...), so after some further analysis I decided to abort this project. 
</p>

<p>Then I started to think of some new project ideas: 
    <ol>
      <li>Spotify Clone</li>
      or
      <li>Linkedin Clone</li>
    </ol>
    . But then I thought I have my blockchain project on my portfolio that I started a few months back - I could go back to that project (that would be very fun!). So that night I thought if I wanted to revist my blockchain project and after a bit of thinking I said: "yes why not!". And now, I'm having lots of writing code, debugging issues and many more issues / problems that you always encounter when making a project (but, this is part of the learing phase!) 
</p>

## What is the importance of this project?
<p>The main objective / importance of this project is to create a fully working project and to learn as much as I can. But, another importance of this project is to 
show future / potential employers that I'm capable of developing a full-stack project, from nothing -> a fully working project (or product, if I was working on a 
  company project.). Although I don't have any professional software devlopment experience, I have lots of expiernce with most of the topics in software development, such 
  as: Dev-Ops, Unit testing, UML, Concurrent Development, Data Structures & algorithms, operating systems, object orientied programming (oop), Software Engineering, Design Patterns, Data Science & Machine Learning and so much more. I also have some expeince in the world of retail. I worked in my local cineam for 3 years and 7 months. While I 
  worked at my local cinema (Movies@ Gorey), I developed these soft skills: teamwork, communication, problem solving, dealing with hard / difficult customers, this developed   my patince, active listening and always being polite no matter the situation and most importantly always being professional in a work environment. 
</p>

## What is this project? 
<p>This project is a small simulation of a blockchain system. The core idea of this project is to create a full-stack project that simiulates how a blockchain system operates.</p>

## Technology Stack
<p>This project is split into both frontend, backend and deployment. See below headings for the tech stack:</p>
<h3>Frontend</h3>
<ul>
  <li>HTML</li>
  <li>CSS</li>
  <li>JavaScript</li>
  <li>React</li>
</ul>

<br>

<h3>Backend</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Go</li>
  <li>Python (mabye in the later stages of the project)</li>
</ul>

<br>

<h3>Deployment</h3>
<p>This part I have not gotten to yet, I'm currently developing the project locally but once the project is coming to a close or looks better than it's currently I will get it to deployed, so people can use and viee my 
this project that I have created. When the project is deployed I'm thinking of using the following deployment stack, see below:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Docker</li>
  <li>AWS (mabye!)</li>
  <li>Vercel</li>
  <li>and I'll do further research of other deployment technologys that I can use</li>
</ul>
