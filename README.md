## Did I start this project a while ago?
<p>Short answer is, <strong>yes</strong>. I was working on this project after I was done my final semester of college. I started to make this project while I waited to get my college results. But once the results 
came out, I just stopped working on the project. This was back roughly at some time in June 2025.</p>

## Why Have I Returned?
<p>The main reason to why I returned to this project, is boredom. I was working on a project but now that project is complete. After I completed that project, I thought of two ideas:
  <ol>
    <li>A Game</li>
    <li>Job Application Tracker</li>
  </ol>
  .
