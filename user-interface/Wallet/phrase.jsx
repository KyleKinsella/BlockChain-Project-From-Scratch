            <p>It's vitally important that you remember your seed phrase. A seed phrase consists of 12 or more 
                randomized words. These words that are given to you, you must remember (if you don't you loose all your assets / funds <strong>forever!</strong>).

                So at this stage get a piece of paper and a pen and write down your words on this page. <strong><u>Do not under
                and circumstances save this on your email, locally on your computer, save it on your phone, do not save this seed in any form of digital way!</u></strong>.

                <p>Ensure that your seed phrase is comletly offline (a phical piece of paper - that is kept in a very safe spot and somewhere you won't loose it!)</p> 
            </p>
        </div>
